# Contributing to OpenClaw hootrix Plugin

Thanks for contributing to `@hootrix/openclaw-hootrix-trace`.

## Before opening an issue

1. Search existing issues first: <https://github.com/hootrix-ai/openclaw-hootrix-trace/issues>
2. Use the matching template:
   - Bug report: [.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.yml](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.yml)
   - Feature request: [.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.yml](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.yml)
3. Include reproducible steps, OpenClaw version, and plugin version.

## Local setup

Prerequisites:

- Node.js `>=22.12.0`
- npm `>=10`

Clone and bootstrap:

```bash
git clone https://github.com//hootrix-ai/openclaw-hootrix-trace.git
cd openclaw-hootrix-trace
npm install
```

Optional runtime config:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

## Development workflow

1. Create a focused branch for your change.
2. Keep changes scoped and avoid unrelated formatting-only edits.
3. Run local checks before opening/updating a PR.

Recommended local checks:

```bash
npm run build
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run test
npm run smoke
```

Packaging changes should preserve the OpenClaw package contract: source metadata
stays in `openclaw.extensions`, installed runtime code stays in
`openclaw.runtimeExtensions`, and `clawhub package validate .` should pass before
publish. ClawHub publishes also require explicit `openclaw.compat.pluginApi` and
`openclaw.build.openclawVersion` metadata in `package.json`.

## Pull requests

Open PRs here: <https://github.com/openclaw-hootrix-trace/pulls>

Please:

1. Prefer opening a draft PR early for feedback.
2. Follow the PR template: [.github/pull_request_template.md](.github/pull_request_template.md)
3. Link related issues using `Fixes #<issue-number>` (or `Resolves #<issue-number>`) in the PR body.
4. Update tests/docs for behavior changes.
5. Call out compatibility changes clearly.

If you use GitHub CLI, common commands are:

```bash
gh pr create --draft
gh pr view --web
```

## Releases

- Publish source of truth is GitHub Release + `.github/workflows/release.yml`.
- Release tags must match `package.json` version exactly as `v<version>`.

## Commit and review expectations

- Keep commits scoped and reviewable.
- Use clear commit messages that describe behavior changes.
- If changing user-facing configuration or CLI behavior, update `README.md`.

## Security and secrets

- Do not commit API keys, tokens, or `.env` files.
- Use `.env.example` as the template for new configuration fields.
